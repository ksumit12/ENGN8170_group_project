# Two-Scanner Boat Tracking System - Complete Setup Guide

## Overview

This system uses **TWO BLE scanners** positioned at the left and right sides of the shed door to accurately detect boat entry and exit direction using RSSI (signal strength) patterns and advanced calibration.

## Quick Start (Complete Process)

### 1. Fresh OS Installation
```bash
# Install Raspberry Pi OS Lite
# Enable SSH
# Connect to network
```

### 2. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd grp_project
```

### 3. Run Complete Setup
```bash
# Full setup with WiFi, security, and calibration
./start_two_scanner_system.sh

# Or skip WiFi if already configured
./start_two_scanner_system.sh --skip-wifi
```

### 4. Run Calibration
```bash
# After system is running, calibrate with your beacon
./run_calibration.sh --mac AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
```

### 5. Restart System
```bash
# Restart with calibration applied
./start_two_scanner_system.sh --skip-calibration
```

## System Architecture

```
                SHED INTERIOR (HARBOR)
                        |
        [Scanner LEFT]  |  [Scanner RIGHT]
          (hci0)        |      (hci1)
                    DOOR OPENING
                        |
                  OUTSIDE (WATER)
```

### Direction Detection Logic

**ENTER (Water → Shed):**
- Boat approaches from outside
- RIGHT scanner sees beacon first (strong signal)
- LEFT scanner signal increases as boat passes through door
- RIGHT signal decreases
- Pattern: RIGHT peak → LEFT peak (negative lag)
- Result: Boat marked IN_HARBOR, trip ended

**LEAVE (Shed → Water):**
- Boat exits from shed
- LEFT scanner sees beacon first (strong signal)
- RIGHT scanner signal increases as boat passes through door
- LEFT signal decreases
- Pattern: LEFT peak → RIGHT peak (positive lag)
- Result: Boat marked OUT, trip starts

## Configuration Files

### Scanner Configuration
**File:** `system/json/scanner_config.json`

```json
{
  "api_host": "localhost",
  "api_port": 8000,
  "gates": [
    {
      "id": "gate-1",
      "hysteresis": { "enter_dbm": -58, "exit_dbm": -64, "min_hold_ms": 1200 },
      "scanners": [
        { "id": "gate-left",  "adapter": "hci0", "rssi_bias_db": 0 },
        { "id": "gate-right", "adapter": "hci1", "rssi_bias_db": 0 }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### FSM Engine Configuration
**File:** `api_server.py` (line 34)

```python
os.environ['FSM_ENGINE'] = 'app.door_lr_engine:DoorLREngine'
```

## Calibration Process

### Why Calibration is Essential

RF signals indoors are unpredictable due to:
- **Multipath**: Signals bounce off walls, ceiling, water
- **Antenna angle**: Small changes in orientation dramatically affect RSSI
- **Hardware variance**: Different BLE adapters have different sensitivities
- **Environmental interference**: Other devices, people moving, humidity

### Calibration Types

#### 1. RF Bias Calibration (Recommended)
```bash
python3 calibration/rf_bias_calibration.py --mac AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
```

**What it does:**
1. **Static Position Calibration**: Records RSSI at CENTER, LEFT, RIGHT positions
2. **Dynamic Movement Calibration**: Records ENTER and LEAVE movement patterns
3. **Bias Compensation**: Calculates RSSI offsets to equalize scanners
4. **Signal Smoothing**: Provides noise reduction parameters

#### 2. Door LR Calibration (Legacy)
```bash
python3 calibration/door_lr_calibration.py --mac AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF --duration 10
```

**What it does:**
1. Tests 3 positions: CENTER, LEFT, RIGHT
2. At each position, tests 3 heights: GROUND, CHEST, OVERHEAD
3. Generates calibration.json with RSSI offsets
4. Provides visual validation plots

### Calibration Positions

**CENTER Position:**
- Place beacon at EXACT center of doorway
- Equidistant from both scanners
- System measures RSSI from both scanners
- Calculates the "bias" (difference)

**LEFT Position:**
- Move beacon close to LEFT scanner (hci0)
- About 0.5-1 meter away
- Clearly favoring left side
- System records left-side characteristics

**RIGHT Position:**
- Move beacon close to RIGHT scanner (hci1)
- About 0.5-1 meter away
- Clearly favoring right side
- System records right-side characteristics
