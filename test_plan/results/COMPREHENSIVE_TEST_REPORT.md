## Test 1: Location Detection

### Objective
Verify the system correctly determines boat location (In Shed vs On Water).

### Methodology
- 5 trials with predefined scenarios
- 10-second sampling periods at 2 Hz
- Boat: RC-001

### Results

| Trial | Expected | Observed | Confidence | Result |
|-------|----------|----------|------------|--------|
| 1 | In Shed | On Water | 0.00 | FAIL |
| 2 | On Water | On Water | 0.00 | PASS |
| 3 | In Shed | On Water | 0.00 | FAIL |
| 4 | On Water | On Water | 0.00 | PASS |
| 5 | In Shed | On Water | 0.00 | FAIL |

**Overall Success Rate: 40.0%** (2/5 trials passed)

### Analysis
- System consistently reports boats as "On Water"
- Direction classifier is not detecting ENTER events properly
- Likely cause: Classifier parameters too strict for test conditions

### Recommendations
1. **Adjust DirectionClassifier Parameters:**
   - Reduce `active_dbm` threshold (currently -90 dBm)
   - Decrease `window_s` for faster detection
   - Lower `dwell_s` requirement
   - Reduce `min_peak_sep_s` for better sensitivity

2. **Enhanced Logging:**
   - Add more debug output to direction classifier
   - Log RSSI values and intermediate calculations

- **Stable System:** No noise-induced false positives

### Recommendations
- System demonstrates excellent stability
- Real-time update mechanism working correctly
- Continue monitoring under higher load conditions

## Simulator Performance

### Test Movements
- **Total Movements:** 6 (3 EXIT, 3 ENTER)
- **Successful:** 1 (16.7%)
- **Failed:** 5 (83.3%)

### Movement Details

| # | Boat | Direction | Expected | Observed | Result | Duration |
|---|------|-----------|----------|----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | RC-002 | EXIT | OUTSIDE | OUTSIDE | PASS | 8.1s |
| 2 | RC-002 | ENTER | INSIDE | OUTSIDE | FAIL | 38.7s |
| 3 | RC-003 | EXIT | OUTSIDE | INSIDE | FAIL | 38.0s |
| 4 | RC-002 | ENTER | INSIDE | OUTSIDE | FAIL | 38.7s |
| 5 | RC-002 | EXIT | OUTSIDE | INSIDE | FAIL | 38.8s |
| 6 | RC-002 | ENTER | INSIDE | OUTSIDE | FAIL | 38.3s |

### Analysis
- First EXIT movement succeeded, indicating basic functionality works
- Subsequent movements failed due to direction classifier not generating events
- Failed movements timeout at ~38s (near the 30s timeout threshold)
- State changes not being detected properly

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Direction Classifier Sensitivity

The DirectionClassifier parameters are too strict for the simulated movements:

```python
# Current parameters (too strict)
params = LRParams(
    active_dbm=-90,        # Too sensitive threshold
    energy_dbm=-85,        # Too low
    delta_db=2.0,          # Too small difference
    dwell_s=0.05,          # Too short
    window_s=0.5,          # Too short
    tau_min_s=0.05,        # Too short
    cooldown_s=1.0,        # Too short
    slope_min_db_per_s=2.0,
    min_peak_sep_s=0.05    # Way too short
)
```

### Recommended Parameter Adjustments

```python
# Recommended parameters (more robust)
params = LRParams(
    active_dbm=-75,        # More realistic threshold
    energy_dbm=-70,        # Higher energy threshold
    delta_db=5.0,          # Larger difference required
    dwell_s=0.5,           # Longer dwell requirement
    window_s=2.0,          # Longer analysis window
    tau_min_s=0.2,         # Longer tau
    cooldown_s=3.0,        # Longer cooldown
    slope_min_db_per_s=5.0,
    min_peak_sep_s=0.5     # Reasonable peak separation
)
```
