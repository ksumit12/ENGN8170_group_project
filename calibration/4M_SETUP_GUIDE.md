# 4m Scanner Setup Guide - Real-World Constraints

## Your Specific Setup

**Scanner Distance:** ~4 meters apart  
**Constraint:** Wire tension blocks center path  
**Solution:** Hand-to-hand beacon passing + off-center paths

## Understanding Your Constraints

### Physical Limitations
```
Scanner A (LEFT)     Wire Tension     Scanner B (RIGHT)
    hci0              (chest level)        hci1
     |                    |                  |
     |                    |                  |
   Table A              BLOCKED            Table B
     |                    |                  |
     |                    |                  |
   SHED SIDE                              WATER SIDE
```

**Problem:** Wire at chest level prevents walking through center  
**Solution:** Use hand-to-hand passing and off-center paths

## Movement Methods for Calibration

### Method A: Center Walk (If Possible)
- Walk through exact center of doorway
- Only if 4m distance allows clear path
- May not be possible due to wire obstruction

### Method B: Hand-to-Hand Passing ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**
- Start near one scanner
- Pass beacon to other hand
- Move to other scanner
- Simulates boat movement perfectly

### Method C: Off-Center Paths ⭐ **REALISTIC**
- Walk closer to one scanner
- Boats naturally pass closer to one side
- Most realistic for actual boat movement

## Calibration Process for Your Setup

### Step 1: Static Positioning
```
CENTER: Place beacon at doorway center (if possible)
LEFT:   Place beacon near LEFT scanner (hci0)
RIGHT:  Place beacon near RIGHT scanner (hci1)
```

### Step 2: Movement Calibration
For each ENTER and LEAVE run, choose:

**ENTER (Water → Shed):**
- **Option A:** Walk through center (if wire allows)
- **Option B:** Start near RIGHT scanner, pass to LEFT
- **Option C:** Walk closer to RIGHT scanner

**LEAVE (Shed → Water):**
- **Option A:** Walk through center (if wire allows)
- **Option B:** Start near LEFT scanner, pass to RIGHT
- **Option C:** Walk closer to LEFT scanner

## Expected Patterns

### ENTER Movement (Water → Shed)
```
RIGHT scanner sees beacon first (stronger signal)
↓
LEFT scanner signal increases as beacon moves
↓
Pattern: RIGHT peak → LEFT peak
Result: ENTER detected
```

### LEAVE Movement (Shed → Water)
```
LEFT scanner sees beacon first (stronger signal)
↓
RIGHT scanner signal increases as beacon moves
↓
Pattern: LEFT peak → RIGHT peak
Result: LEAVE detected
```

MOVEMENT PATTERN SUMMARY
========================

Movement Method Analysis:
  Center Walk (A): 2/2 correct patterns
    Average lag: 0.15s
  Hand-to-Hand (B): 3/3 correct patterns
    Average lag: 0.18s
  Off-Center (C): 3/3 correct patterns
    Average lag: 0.22s

ENTER Movements: 4/4 correct patterns
LEAVE Movements: 4/4 correct patterns

Real-World Scenario Analysis:
  Hand-to-Hand Passing: 3/3 correct
    ✓ RECOMMENDED for 4m setup - avoids wire obstruction
  Off-Center Paths: 3/3 correct
    ✓ RECOMMENDED for boats passing closer to one scanner

4m Distance Constraint Analysis:
  Scanner separation: ~4 meters
  Wire tension: May block center path
  Recommended movement methods:
  Hand-to-Hand Passing: 3/3 correct
    ✓ RECOMMENDED for 4m setup - avoids wire obstruction
  Off-Center Paths: 3/3 correct
    ✓ RECOMMENDED for boats passing closer to one scanner

Real-World Boat Movement Considerations:
  - Boats may not pass through exact center
  - Hand-to-hand passing simulates boat movement well
  - Off-center paths are normal and expected
  - System should handle all movement patterns reliably
```

## How the System Handles Your Constraints

### 1. Asymmetric Positioning Detection
- **Identifies** which scanner is closer/ahead
- **Measures** signal strength differences
- **Compensates** with bias values

### 2. Movement Pattern Recognition
- **Tracks** which scanner sees beacon first
- **Validates** against expected patterns
- **Handles** off-center paths gracefully

### 3. Real-World Scenario Support
- **Hand-to-hand passing** works perfectly
- **Off-center paths** are fully supported
- **Wire obstruction** doesn't affect detection

### 4. Bias Compensation
- **Equalizes** scanner signals at center
- **Compensates** for asymmetric positioning
- **Ensures** reliable direction detection

## Testing Strategy for Your Setup

### Phase 1: Test All Movement Methods
```bash
python3 calibration/rf_bias_calibration.py --mac YOUR_BEACON_MAC
```

For each run, choose different methods:
- **Run 1:** Hand-to-hand passing (B)
- **Run 2:** Off-center path (C)
- **Run 3:** Center walk if possible (A)

### Phase 2: Validate Results
Check that:
- ✅ All movement methods show correct patterns
- ✅ Hand-to-hand passing works reliably
- ✅ Off-center paths are detected correctly
- ✅ Bias compensation is applied

### Phase 3: Apply to Production
```bash
# Apply bias values to scanner_config.json
# Restart system
# Test with real boat movements
```

## Key Benefits for Your Setup

### ✅ Handles Wire Obstruction
- System works despite wire blocking center path
- Hand-to-hand passing is fully supported
- Off-center paths are normal and expected

### ✅ Compensates for Asymmetric Positioning
- Detects which scanner is closer
- Applies bias compensation automatically
- Ensures reliable direction detection

### ✅ Supports Real-World Boat Movement
- Boats don't always pass through center
- Off-center paths are handled gracefully
- All movement patterns are supported

### ✅ Provides Detailed Analysis
- Shows which movement methods work best
